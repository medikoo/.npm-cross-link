# .npm-cross-link

Personal configuration resolver for [npm-cross-link](https://github.com/medikoo/npm-cross-link).

-   Resolves all my projects from github, filters ones which are not destined for npm
-   Configures hook that ensures custom version of [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is setup for each package (so it's automatically picked by the editor)
